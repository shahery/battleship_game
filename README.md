# Testing
  I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
  * Passed the code through a PEP8 linter and confirmed there are no problems
  * Given invalid inputs: strings when numbers are expected, out of bounds inputs, same input twice
  * Tested in my local terminal and the Code Institute Heroku terminal

 ## Validator Testing
   * PEP8
     * No errors were returned from [PEP8 checker](http://pep8online.com/)
